</div>

Hi there! My name is Jennifer (she/her), and I am a recent graduate of Columbia University, where I studied Political Science with a focus on International Relations. I am currently studying Computer Science at WGU. I have worked in various fields, ranging from military healthcare and IT to education. My interest in tech began during the pandemic when I was introduced to coding by a professor who was building a website to make educational materials more accessible to low-income students through technology. This sparked my own interest in getting into coding, as I could intertwine my diverse background to make a difference.

I currently work as a T.A. for calculus and algebra courses at the CUNY system, also providing content for open educational resources (OER) for math students.

Please feel free to connect with me if you have any questions or if you would like to learn more about my background and interests. I am open to new opportunities and would love to explore potential collaborations.
